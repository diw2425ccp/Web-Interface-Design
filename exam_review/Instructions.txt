1. Customize Bootstrap:

Change primary and secondary colors.
Disable default border-radius for all components.
Add a new tertiary color to the theme.
Add a new margin and padding level.

2. Use Bootstrap:

The main header should have a large centered display text and use the primary color.
Use card component inside main section.
Apply margin and padding to the cards.
Buttons inside the cards should be secondary color and large size buttons.
Ensure each card takes up the entire row on small screens, half the row on medium screens and one-third of the row on large screens.

3. Create a mixin to apply padding and margin. 

The mixing should have one parameter.
If the parameter is positive, it should be used for both padding and margin.
If the parameter is 0 or negative, both should be set to 0.

4. Create a base class for a banner component with Sass.  

This base class should inherit Bootstrap classes for:
Light background color
Secondary text color
Lead text
Tertiary color border
When hovered, the banner should change its background color to info color.
The button inside the banner should use an outlined tertiary color style
Set margin and padding using the created mixin.

5. Generate three size variants of the banner:

Small (width: 25%)
Medium (width: 50%)
Large (width: 75%)
Apply the medium banner class to the last section in the document.
